## General Information
#Assignment Brief:
Solving this assignment will give you an idea about how real business problems are solved using EDA. In this case study, apart from applying the techniques you have learnt in EDA, you will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

#Business understanding:
The Lending club company is a financial lending company which forms a bridge between 
borrower and lenders by it's online platform and gives loan at a lower interest rate.
• Like Any other finance lending company it does not want to have loss due to defaults.
What is default ?
• If a borrower does not pay it's due or term against the loan , or runs away with the sum he 
has taken then he/she considered as defaulter , in such case financial lender suffers loss.
What is the action we can take about the applicants who are likely to default ?
• We can take some measures against such applicants : 1 such as denying for loan 2 
giving loan in a higher interest 3 OR decrease the amount of loan for risky customers
The problem statement.
• The problem statement here is to find out the important variables or attributes of 
customers and the loan which are inducing the default , which in turn is causing credit 
loss to the lending company (.i.e. Lending Club) , which in future will direct the decision of 
the investor whether to invest the loan amount on a particular borrower or not , and there 
by cutting the financial loss of LC

## Conclusions
We have found following pointers from our analysis-:
• More higher loan amount is a causation of charged off in case of higher term and Risk grade.
• Defaulters are having less annual income than the fully paid Borrowers , which is boosting default 
heavily.
• DTI is a risk contributing factor in case of most population.
• Revolving balance is positively contributing to the charged off population.
• Revolving balance utilization is significantly contributing to the charged off population.
• Grade of risk given by lending club is very much likely to be true in case of contribution to charged 
off as we have seen in our analysis .
• Term is also serving as an important indicator of risk for sure
